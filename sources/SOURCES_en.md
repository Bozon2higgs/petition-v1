# Sources and Legal Foundations

This petition is grounded in **internationally recognized legal instruments**, **United Nations treaties**, and **established legal doctrine** relating to public debt, democratic consent, and fundamental human rights.

It does not rely on a single national case, political position, or economic model.  
Its purpose is to articulate a **general normative framework** applicable across jurisdictions and institutional contexts.

## I. Purpose and Scope of This Document

This document identifies the legal and normative sources that inform the petition.

It does not constitute:
- a legal judgment,
- a judicial decision,
- a formal accusation against specific actors.

Its function is to clarify the **existing legal principles** on which the petition is based and to ensure transparency regarding its foundations.

---

## II. International Legal Instruments

### 1. Charter of the United Nations (1945)

The petition is grounded in the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, in particular:
- the primacy of human rights,
- the obligation of international cooperation,
- the commitment to promote social progress and improved standards of living.

These principles establish that **financial and economic obligations cannot override fundamental human rights commitments** undertaken by States.

---

### 2. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)

The petition draws directly on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, notably:
- the obligation to progressively realize economic, social, and cultural rights,
- the prohibition of unjustified retrogressive measures,
- State responsibility for access to health, education, housing, work, and social protection.

The relationship between **public debt policies and social rights** is central to this covenant and to the petition’s analytical framework.

---

### 3. Right of Peoples to Self-Determination

As recognized in Article 1 common to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right of peoples to self-determination underpins sections of the petition addressing:
- the absence of effective democratic consent,
- the burden imposed on present and future generations by long-term public debt obligations.

---

## III. General Principles of Human Rights Law

### 4. Principle of Non-Regression

The principle of non-regression, developed through international jurisprudence and the practice of United Nations treaty bodies, holds that:
> States should not adopt policies that lead to a durable deterioration of fundamental rights without compelling and proportionate justification.

This principle directly informs the petition’s analysis of austerity measures and debt-servicing policies.

---

### 5. State Obligations and Proportionality

International human rights law requires States to:
- assess the foreseeable impact of economic policies on fundamental rights,
- ensure proportionality between policy objectives and social harm,
- prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations.

These obligations are relevant when evaluating debt-related fiscal measures.

---

## IV. Legal Doctrine on Illegitimate and Odious Debt

### 6. Odious Debt Doctrine (Alexander Sack, 1927)

The petition is structurally aligned with the doctrine of odious debt, formulated by Alexander Sack, which identifies three cumulative criteria:
1. absence of genuine public consent,
2. absence of benefit for the population,
3. creditor awareness of these conditions.

These criteria are used **as an analytical framework**, without asserting automatic legal invalidity of any specific debt.

---

### 7. Contemporary Legal and Institutional Practice

The petition reflects reasoning developed in:
- international legal scholarship,
- parliamentary and independent debt audit processes,
- reports and analyses by international and regional institutions.

The text is deliberately abstract in order to remain applicable across different legal and political systems.

---

## V. Methodological Clarifications and Limits

This petition:
- does not declare any specific debt illegal or void,
- does not replace judicial or arbitration mechanisms,
- does not constitute a refusal of international cooperation or solidarity.

It constitutes a **reference document**, intended to:
- support analysis and debate,
- inform institutional, academic, and civil society initiatives,
- contribute to policy and legal reflection at national and international levels.

---

## Conclusion

This petition is anchored in **existing international law and recognized legal doctrine**.  
It seeks to reaffirm the principle that **human rights obligations must prevail over illegitimate financial constraints**, in accordance with the commitments already undertaken by States under international law.
