  <h1>International Petition</h1>
  <p>Reference document – Version 1.1</p>
</header>

<main>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
We, citizens and residents, taxpayers and persons affected by public debt policies,
considering that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>States have a primary obligation to guarantee fundamental human rights;</li>
  <li>These obligations prevail over financial constraints;</li>
  <li>Certain public debts were contracted without genuine democratic consent, without benefit to the populations, and with creditors’ knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We wish to draw the attention of national and international institutions to the structural
and ongoing violations of human rights resulting from illegitimate public debt repayment policies.
</p>

<h2>I. Legal foundations</h2>
<p>This petition is based in particular on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Charter of the United Nations;</li>
  <li>The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;</li>
  <li>The principle of peoples’ right to self-determination;</li>
  <li>The obligation of non-regression in fundamental rights;</li>
  <li>The shared responsibility of public and private actors in human rights violations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Findings</h2>
<p>
In many countries, public debt servicing leads to lasting cuts in health, education, housing
and social protection budgets, imposed austerity policies, deteriorating living conditions,
and violations of dignity and economic security.
</p>

<h2>III. Absence of democratic consent</h2>
<p>
Many debts were contracted without explicit popular mandate or informed democratic debate,
and their consequences are borne by current and future generations without consent.
</p>

<h2>IV. Absence of benefit for populations</h2>
<p>
A significant portion of these debts did not serve essential infrastructure or social rights,
but instead benefited private interests or refinanced previous debts without democratic control.
</p>

<h2>V. Creditors’ awareness</h2>
<p>
Institutional and private creditors could not ignore the non-democratic nature of certain
decisions and the foreseeable human rights impacts of repayment policies.
</p>

<h2>VI. Our demands</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Independent, transparent and public debt audits;</li>
  <li>Suspension of repayments that violate fundamental rights;</li>
  <li>Recognition of illegitimate or odious debts;</li>
  <li>Protection of populations against economic retaliation;</li>
  <li>Referral to international human rights mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
No people should be forced to renounce their fundamental rights in order to repay debts
contracted against their interests.
