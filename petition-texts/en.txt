INTERNATIONAL PETITION on the effects of illegitimate public debts on fundamental human rights
Preamble
We, citizens, residents, taxpayers and persons affected by public policies related to debt servicing, considering that:
	•	States have the primary obligation to guarantee fundamental human rights; 
	•	these obligations prevail over any financial constraint; 
	•	certain public debts have been contracted without genuine democratic consent, without benefit to the populations, and with the knowledge of creditors; 
wish to draw the attention of national and international institutions to the structural and ongoing violations of human rights resulting from the repayment of illegitimate public debts.
I. Legal foundations
This petition is based in particular on:
	•	the Charter of the United Nations; 
	•	the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
	•	the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination; 
	•	the obligation of non-regression in fundamental rights; 
	•	the shared responsibility of public and private actors in human rights violations. 
These texts commit States not to subordinate access to fundamental rights to avoidable or illegitimate financial constraints.
II. Findings
In many countries, public debt servicing leads to:
	•	lasting reductions in health, education, housing and social protection budgets; 
	•	austerity policies imposed without effective popular consultation; 
	•	a measurable deterioration of living conditions; 
	•	an infringement of the right to dignity, economic security and equality before public burdens. 
These effects are neither temporary nor accidental: they are structural.
III. Absence of democratic consent
We observe that:
	•	many debts were contracted without explicit popular mandate; 
	•	their conditions were not subject to informed democratic debate; 
	•	current populations, including future generations, bear the consequences without having consented to these commitments. 
This situation constitutes a manifest breach of the principle of consent, a central element of the legitimacy of public debts.
IV. Absence of benefit for populations
A significant share of the debts concerned was not used:
	•	to improve essential infrastructure; 
	•	to guarantee social rights; 
	•	to strengthen the economic resilience of populations. 
On the contrary, it contributed to:
	•	the stabilization of contested political or economic systems; 
	•	the enrichment of private interests; 
	•	the refinancing of prior debts without democratic oversight. 
V. Knowledge of creditors
Institutional and private creditors could not ignore:
	•	the non-democratic or constrained nature of certain borrowing decisions; 
	•	the foreseeable consequences of repayment policies on human rights; 
	•	repeated warnings from experts, international organizations and NGOs. 
This knowledge engages their moral and political responsibility and calls for a thorough legal examination.
VI. Our demands
We formally request:
	1.	The opening of independent, transparent and public audits of the public debts concerned; 
	2.	The suspension of repayments when they undermine fundamental human rights; 
	3.	The recognition of the illegitimate or odious nature of debts meeting the criteria of lack of consent, lack of benefit and creditor awareness; 
	4.	The protection of populations against any economic or financial retaliation; 
	5.	The referral of competent mechanisms of the international human rights system so that these situations may be subject to official examination. 
VII. Scope of this petition
This petition:
	•	does not constitute a rejection of international solidarity; 
	•	does not call into question the principle of public responsibility; 
	•	aims exclusively to ensure the primacy of human rights over illegitimate financial commitments. 
It is intended to:
	•	support national and international legal actions; 
	•	inform expert reports and the work of special rapporteurs; 
	•	legitimize political initiatives consistent with international law. 
Conclusion
We affirm that no people should be forced to renounce their fundamental rights in order to honor debts contracted against their interests.
