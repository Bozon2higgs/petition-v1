# About This Project

## 1. Purpose of the Project

This project provides a neutral, international and multilingual reference framework for the dissemination and reuse of a global petition text.

Its purpose is to facilitate access to a legally grounded document that can be read, cited, transmitted, and reused by individuals, organizations, researchers, journalists, and institutions without political or legal affiliation.

This repository does not seek to replace existing advocacy efforts, but to offer a stable and documented textual foundation.

---

## 2. Methodology

The petition text was developed through:

- analysis of existing international legal frameworks,
- reference to recognized international treaties and doctrines,
- careful linguistic alignment across multiple languages,
- prioritization of clarity, accessibility, and legal neutrality.

Each language version is intended to convey the same meaning and structure.

---

## 3. Editorial Neutrality

This project maintains strict editorial neutrality:

- no political affiliation,
- no institutional mandate,
- no partisan positioning.

The content is presented as a documentary and preparatory resource, not as an advocacy campaign or political statement.

---

## 4. Legal Positioning

This project is explicitly **not**:

- a legal judgment,
- a judicial complaint,
- a call for illegal action,
- a formal legal procedure.

It **is**:

- a reference document,
- a civic information tool,
- a reusable textual basis for lawful initiatives.

---

## 5. Governance & Versioning

The current version is identified as **Version 1.0**.

Future revisions, if any, will follow these principles:

- transparency of changes,
- preservation of prior versions,
- clear version numbering.

---

## 6. Use, Citation & Reuse

The petition text may be:

- read and shared freely,
- cited in academic or institutional contexts,
- reused as a reference document.

Proper attribution to this repository is recommended.

---

## 7. Language & Accessibility

This project is intentionally multilingual.

All language versions are made available to ensure accessibility and international usability.

Translations aim for equivalence of meaning rather than literal word-for-word correspondence.
