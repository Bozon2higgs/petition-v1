  <p><strong>Reader note</strong></p>
  <p>
    This document is an international reference petition,
    written in neutral legal language.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may read it in full or by sections.</li>
    <li>No action is required to consult this document.</li>
    <li>This text does not constitute a political position.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>
We, citizens, residents, taxpayers, and persons affected by public policies related to debt servicing,
considering that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>States have the primary obligation to guarantee fundamental human rights;</li>
  <li>these obligations prevail over any financial constraint;</li>
  <li>certain public debts have been contracted without genuine democratic consent,
      without benefit to the populations, and with the knowledge of creditors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We wish to draw the attention of national and international institutions
to the structural and ongoing violations of human rights
resulting from the repayment of illegitimate public debts.
</p>

<h2>I. Legal Foundations</h2>

<p>This petition is based in particular on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Charter of the United Nations;</li>
  <li>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;</li>
  <li>the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination;</li>
  <li>the obligation of non-regression in fundamental rights;</li>
  <li>the shared responsibility of public and private actors in human rights violations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These texts commit States not to subordinate access to fundamental rights
to avoidable or illegitimate financial constraints.
</p>

<h2>II. Findings</h2>

<p>In many countries, public debt servicing leads to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lasting reductions in health, education, housing, and social protection budgets;</li>
  <li>austerity policies imposed without effective popular consultation;</li>
  <li>a measurable deterioration of living conditions;</li>
  <li>an infringement of the right to dignity, economic security, and equality before public burdens.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These effects are neither temporary nor accidental: they are structural.
</p>

<h2>III. Absence of Democratic Consent</h2>

<p>We observe that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>many debts were contracted without explicit popular mandate;</li>
  <li>their conditions were not subject to informed democratic debate;</li>
  <li>current populations, including future generations, bear the consequences
      without having consented to these commitments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This situation constitutes a manifest breach of the principle of consent,
a central element of the legitimacy of public debts.
</p>

<h2>IV. Absence of Benefit for Populations</h2>

<p>
A significant share of the debts concerned was not used to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve essential infrastructure;</li>
  <li>guarantee social rights;</li>
  <li>strengthen the economic resilience of populations.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the contrary, it contributed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the stabilization of contested political or economic systems;</li>
  <li>the enrichment of private interests;</li>
  <li>the refinancing of prior debts without democratic oversight.</li>
</ul>

<h2>V. Knowledge of Creditors</h2>

<p>Institutional and private creditors could not ignore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the non-democratic or constrained nature of certain borrowing decisions;</li>
  <li>the foreseeable consequences of repayment policies on human rights;</li>
  <li>the repeated warnings of experts, international organizations, and NGOs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This knowledge engages their moral and political responsibility
and calls for thorough legal examination.
</p>

<h2>VI. Our Demands</h2>

<p>We formally demand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the opening of independent, transparent, and public audits of the public debts concerned;</li>
  <li>the suspension of repayments when they undermine fundamental human rights;</li>
  <li>the recognition of the illegitimate or odious nature of debts meeting
      the criteria of lack of consent, lack of benefit, and creditor awareness;</li>
  <li>the protection of populations against any economic or financial retaliation;</li>
  <li>the referral of competent mechanisms of the international human rights system
      so that these situations may be subject to official examination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We reaffirm that no people should be forced to renounce its fundamental rights
in order to service debts contracted against its interests.
