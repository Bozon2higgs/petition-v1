<p>
This petition is grounded in <strong>internationally recognized legal instruments</strong>,
<strong>United Nations treaties</strong>, and <strong>established legal doctrine</strong>
relating to public debt, democratic consent, and fundamental human rights.
</p>

<p>
It does not rely on a single national case, political position, or economic model.
Its purpose is to articulate a <strong>general normative framework</strong>
applicable across jurisdictions and institutional contexts.
</p>

<h2>I. Purpose and Scope of This Document</h2>

<p>
This document identifies the legal and normative sources that inform the petition.
</p>

<p>It does not constitute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a legal judgment,</li>
  <li>a judicial decision,</li>
  <li>a formal accusation against specific actors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Its function is to clarify the <strong>existing legal principles</strong>
on which the petition is based and to ensure transparency regarding its foundations.
</p>

<h2>II. International Legal Instruments</h2>

<h3>1. Charter of the United Nations (1945)</h3>

<p>
The petition is grounded in the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,
in particular:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the primacy of human rights,</li>
  <li>the obligation of international cooperation,</li>
  <li>the commitment to promote social progress and improved standards of living.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These principles establish that <strong>financial and economic obligations cannot override
fundamental human rights commitments</strong> undertaken by States.
</p>

<h3>2. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)</h3>

<p>
The petition draws directly on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
notably:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the obligation to progressively realize economic, social, and cultural rights,</li>
  <li>the prohibition of unjustified retrogressive measures,</li>
  <li>State responsibility for access to health, education, housing, work, and social protection.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The relationship between <strong>public debt policies and social rights</strong>
is central to this covenant and to the petition’s analytical framework.
</p>

<h3>3. Right of Peoples to Self-Determination</h3>

<p>
As recognized in Article 1 common to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
the right of peoples to self-determination underpins sections of the petition addressing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the absence of effective democratic consent,</li>
  <li>the burden imposed on present and future generations by long-term public debt obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>III. General Principles of Human Rights Law</h2>

<h3>4. Principle of Non-Regression</h3>

<p>
The principle of non-regression, developed through international jurisprudence
and the practice of United Nations treaty bodies, holds that:
</p>

<blockquote>
  States should not adopt policies that lead to a durable deterioration of fundamental rights
  without compelling and proportionate justification.
</blockquote>

<p>
This principle directly informs the petition’s analysis of austerity measures
and debt-servicing policies.
</p>

<h3>5. State Obligations and Proportionality</h3>

<p>
International human rights law requires States to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess the foreseeable impact of economic policies on fundamental rights,</li>
  <li>ensure proportionality between policy objectives and social harm,</li>
  <li>prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These obligations are relevant when evaluating debt-related fiscal measures.
</p>

<h2>IV. Legal Doctrine on Illegitimate and Odious Debt</h2>

<h3>6. Odious Debt Doctrine (Alexander Sack, 1927)</h3>

<p>
The petition is structurally aligned with the doctrine of odious debt,
formulated by Alexander Sack, which identifies three cumulative criteria:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>absence of genuine public consent,</li>
  <li>absence of benefit for the population,</li>
  <li>creditor awareness of these conditions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These criteria are used <strong>as an analytical framework</strong>,
without asserting automatic legal invalidity of any specific debt.
</p>

<h3>7. Contemporary Legal and Institutional Practice</h3>

<p>
The petition reflects reasoning developed in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>international legal scholarship,</li>
  <li>parliamentary and independent debt audit processes,</li>
  <li>reports and analyses by international and regional institutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The text is deliberately abstract in order to remain applicable across different
legal and political systems.
</p>

<h2>V. Methodological Clarifications and Limits</h2>

<p>This petition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not declare any specific debt illegal or void,</li>
  <li>does not replace judicial or arbitration mechanisms,</li>
  <li>does not constitute a refusal of international cooperation or solidarity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It constitutes a <strong>reference document</strong>, intended to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>support analysis and debate,</li>
  <li>inform institutional, academic, and civil society initiatives,</li>
  <li>contribute to policy and legal reflection at national and international levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This petition is anchored in <strong>existing international law and recognized legal doctrine</strong>.
It seeks to reaffirm the principle that
<strong>human rights obligations must prevail over illegitimate financial constraints</strong>,
in accordance with the commitments already undertaken by States under international law.
