# Sources and Legal Foundations

This petition is grounded in **internationally recognized legal instruments**, **United Nations treaties**, and **established legal doctrine** relating to public debt, democratic consent, and fundamental human rights.

It does not rely on a single national case or specific economic model.  
Its purpose is to articulate a **general normative framework** applicable across contexts.

## I. International Legal Instruments

### 1. Charter of the United Nations (1945)
The petition is based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, in particular:
- the primacy of human rights,
- the obligation of international cooperation,
- the responsibility of States to promote social progress and better standards of life.

These principles establish that **financial obligations cannot override fundamental human rights commitments**.

---

### 2. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)
The petition draws directly on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, notably:
- the obligation to progressively realize economic and social rights,
- the prohibition of unjustified retrogressive measures,
- State responsibility for access to health, education, housing, and social protection.

The link between **public debt policies and social rights** is central to this covenant.

---

### 3. Principle of Non-Regression of Fundamental Rights
The principle of non-regression, developed through international jurisprudence and UN treaty bodies, holds that:
> States should not adopt policies that lead to a durable deterioration of fundamental rights without compelling justification.

This principle directly informs the petition’s analysis of austerity and debt servicing policies.

---

### 4. Right of Peoples to Self-Determination
As recognized in Article 1 common to the International Covenants, the right of peoples to self-determination underpins the sections of the petition addressing:
- the absence of democratic consent,
- the burden imposed on present and future generations.

---

## II. Legal Doctrine on Illegitimate and Odious Debt

### 5. Doctrine of Odious Debt (Alexander Sack, 1927)
The petition is structurally aligned with the doctrine of odious debt, which identifies three key criteria:
1. absence of genuine public consent,
2. absence of benefit for the population,
3. creditor awareness of these conditions.

These criteria inform the analytical framework of the petition without asserting automatic legal invalidity.

---

### 6. International Practice and Precedents
While not citing specific cases, the petition reflects reasoning developed in:
- international arbitration,
- parliamentary debt audits,
- academic and legal analyses of sovereign debt legitimacy.

The text is deliberately abstract to remain universally applicable.

---

## III. United Nations Expertise and Reports

### 7. UN Special Rapporteurs on Debt and Human Rights
The petition is informed by reports of UN Special Rapporteurs addressing:
- external debt and human rights,
- the social impact of austerity policies,
- financial conditionality and democratic governance.

These reports consistently highlight the structural nature of rights violations linked to debt servicing.

---

### 8. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
The petition reflects the principle of **shared responsibility** between public and private actors, including creditors, in situations involving foreseeable human rights impacts.

---

## IV. Scope and Methodological Clarification

This petition:
- does not claim to be a legal judgment,
- does not substitute for judicial proceedings,
- does not assert automatic illegality of any specific debt.

It constitutes a **reference document**, intended to:
- support analysis and debate,
- inform institutional and civil society initiatives,
- contribute to policy and legal reflection at national and international levels.

---

## Conclusion

The petition is anchored in **existing international law and recognized legal doctrine**.  
It seeks to reaffirm the principle that **human rights obligations must prevail over illegitimate financial constraints**.
