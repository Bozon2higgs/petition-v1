  <h1>About This Project</h1>
</header>

<main>

<h2>1. Purpose of the Project</h2>

<p>
This project provides a neutral, international and multilingual reference framework for the dissemination and reuse of a global petition text.
</p>

<p>
Its purpose is to facilitate access to a legally grounded document that can be read, cited, transmitted, and reused by individuals, organizations, researchers, journalists, and institutions without political or legal affiliation.
</p>

<p>
This repository does not seek to replace existing advocacy efforts, but to offer a stable and documented textual foundation.
</p>

<h2>2. Methodology</h2>

<p>
The petition text was developed through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>analysis of existing international legal frameworks,</li>
  <li>reference to recognized international treaties and doctrines,</li>
  <li>careful linguistic alignment across multiple languages,</li>
  <li>prioritization of clarity, accessibility, and legal neutrality.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each language version is intended to convey the same meaning and structure.
</p>

<h2>3. Editorial Neutrality</h2>

<p>
This project maintains strict editorial neutrality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>no political affiliation,</li>
  <li>no institutional mandate,</li>
  <li>no partisan positioning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The content is presented as a documentary and preparatory resource, not as an advocacy campaign or political statement.
</p>

<h2>4. Legal Positioning</h2>

<p>
This project is explicitly <strong>not</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a legal judgment,</li>
  <li>a judicial complaint,</li>
  <li>a call for illegal action,</li>
  <li>a formal legal procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It <strong>is</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reference document,</li>
  <li>a civic information tool,</li>
  <li>a reusable textual basis for lawful initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Governance &amp; Versioning</h2>

<p>
The current version is identified as <strong>Version 1.0</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Future revisions, if any, will follow these principles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>transparency of changes,</li>
  <li>preservation of prior versions,</li>
  <li>clear version numbering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Use, Citation &amp; Reuse</h2>

<p>
The petition text may be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>read and shared freely,</li>
  <li>cited in academic or institutional contexts,</li>
  <li>reused as a reference document.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Proper attribution to this repository is recommended.
</p>

<h2>7. Language &amp; Accessibility</h2>

<p>
This project is intentionally multilingual.
</p>

<p>
All language versions are made available to ensure accessibility and international usability.
</p>

<p>
Translations aim for equivalence of meaning rather than literal word-for-word correspondence.
